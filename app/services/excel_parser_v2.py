Your task is to analyze the provided Excel table text and generate a comprehensive, well-structured text output that clearly identifies:

1. **SHEET OVERVIEW**: Basic information about the sheet structure
2. **HEADER ANALYSIS**: Column structure and data types
3. **QUESTION STRUCTURE**: All questions with their exact locations and response requirements
4. **RESPONSE MAPPING**: Where each type of response should be filled
5. **HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIPS**: Parent-child question relationships
6. **SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: Any specific requirements or constraints

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear, descriptive language that another LLM can easily parse
- Include exact row and column references (e.g., "Row 15, Column C")
- Identify all response types (Yes/No, text, options, dates, etc.)
- Show hierarchical relationships clearly
- Highlight any special instructions or constraints
- Use consistent formatting throughout
- Make it easy for another LLM to understand where to place responses

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a comprehensive text analysis in the following structure:

# EXCEL SHEET ANALYSIS

## SHEET OVERVIEW
[Basic sheet information, total rows, columns, etc.]

## HEADER STRUCTURE
[Column analysis with data types and purposes]

## QUESTION ANALYSIS
[Detailed breakdown of all questions with locations and requirements]

## RESPONSE MAPPING
[Clear mapping of where each response type should be filled]

## HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE
[Parent-child relationships and dependencies]

## SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

## FILLING INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM
