Compass Group utilizes several key computer applications to manage its financial and operational processes, particularly within its Bon Appetit division. The primary point-of-sale system is Agilysys, an externally developed software used for restaurant transactions and payments. This system is provided by Agilysys and does not include any custom features, nor does Compass Group have access to its source code. For event management, Bon Appetit employs TripleSeat, another externally developed application that handles event planning but does not process payments. Credit card payments for events are processed through Authorize.Net, a separate external system. Neither TripleSeat nor Authorize.Net have custom features, and Compass Group does not have access to their source codes. In addition to these external systems, Bon Appetit maintains an internally developed dining website using Squarespace. This website does not process transactions but is accessible to both Bon Appetit and its restaurant customers, with Compass Group having access to its source code. This combination of externally and internally developed applications enables Compass Group to efficiently manage its restaurant operations, event planning, and payment processing across its Bon Appetit brand.

Compass Group North America outsources all software used for food service payment processing, including systems for cafes, mobile ordering, and catering. The company does not directly provide or develop software to facilitate payment for food services. Instead, they rely on point-of-sale providers who undergo annual PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) validation conducted by approved independent third parties. This validation process includes specific assessments of secure software development practices, with a focus on data integrity and data validation. By outsourcing these critical payment systems, Compass Group ensures compliance with industry standards without directly managing the technical aspects of payment processing or associated accounting functions. This approach allows the company to focus on its core food service operations while leveraging specialized providers for secure and compliant payment solutions.

This approach eliminates potential risks associated with spreadsheet-based financial operations, such as data entry errors, formula manipulation, or unauthorized access. By avoiding the use of custom spreadsheets, Compass Group likely relies on more robust, purpose-built financial software systems, which typically offer enhanced security features, audit trails, and automated controls. This practice aligns with best practices in financial management and data integrity, reducing the need for manual spreadsheet protection measures like password security, color-coded input fields, or formula locking.
