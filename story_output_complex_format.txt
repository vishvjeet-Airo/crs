Compass Group utilizes a variety of software applications to manage its operations, particularly in the food service sector. For point-of-sale restaurant transactions and payments, Bon Appetit, a division of Compass Group, uses Agilysys, which is provided by the service organization Agilysys. This application is not internally developed, and Compass Group does not have access to its source code. The company also maintains a dining website using Squarespace, which is internally developed by Bon Appetit. This website does not process transactions but is accessible to both Bon Appetit and restaurant customers.

For event management, Bon Appetit employs TripleSeat, a third-party software that does not handle payments directly. When it comes to processing credit card payments for events, Authorize.Net is used. Both TripleSeat and Authorize.Net are externally developed applications, and Compass Group does not have access to their source codes. These applications are specifically used by the Bon Appetit division of Compass Group.

Compass Group North America outsources all software used for providing payment services in food service operations, including cafes, mobile ordering, and catering. The company's point-of-sale providers undergo annual PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) validation by an approved independent third party. This validation process includes specific questions about secure software development practices, focusing on data integrity and data validation. It's important to note that Compass Group North America does not directly provide software to facilitate payment for food services.

Regarding internal financial processes, Compass Group has indicated that questions about depreciation calculation, fixed asset recording, and cash account reconciliation are not applicable to their operations. The company does not use entity-developed spreadsheets for accounting functions or transaction processing. For more detailed information about Compass Group's IT environment, including computer hardware and configuration used for accounting systems, they refer to an attached data security PDF document.

Compass Group's approach to ensuring the reliability of its IT systems and data security is primarily through the use of third-party validated services, particularly for payment processing. The company relies on the PCI DSS validation of its service providers to ensure secure software development practices. This strategy allows Compass Group to leverage specialized expertise in payment security while focusing on its core business of food service management.
