Compass Group / Bon Appetit provided information about their significant computer applications and transaction processes as of October 30, 2024. The company uses several key applications for its operations. Agilysys, a third-party service, is used for point-of-sale restaurant transactions and payments, specifically by Bon Appetit. The company's dining website is built on Squarespace, internally developed by Bon Appetit, and used by both Bon Appetit and restaurant customers, though it doesn't process transactions. For event management, Bon Appetit employs TripleSeat, which doesn't handle payments. Credit card payments for events are processed through Authorize.Net. None of these third-party applications offer access to their source code, and no custom features are reported for any of them. Regarding financial processes, Compass Group North America outsources all software used for food service payments, including cafe, mobile ordering, and catering. Their point-of-sale providers undergo annual PCI DSS validation by an approved independent third party, which includes assessments of secure software development practices, data integrity, and data validation. Compass Group North America does not directly provide software for food service payments. The company does not use entity-developed spreadsheets for accounting functions or transaction processing. For more detailed information about their IT environment, including computer hardware and configuration used for the accounting system, Compass Group refers to an attached data security PDF. The company did not provide specific information about individuals with access to post to the general ledger or about nonstandard journal entries, marking this as not applicable.
